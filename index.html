                <p>Medical abortion (also known as home abortion or pill abortion) is a safe, easy and cheapest method of terminating a pregnancy.</p>
                <p>Before you terminate your pregnancy with pills, it is worth preparing well for it. Medical abortion is the safest method and carries the lowest risk of complications, but in order to consciously decide on it, you need to know how it works.
                Good preparation will also allow you not only to protect yourself from taking medication incorrectly, but will also give you more comfort, peace of mind and confidence during the process.</p>
                <p>The following summary of information will allow you to prepare for a self-abortion at home, order abortion medication from a reliable source, or correctly dose medications based on mifepristone and misoprostol.
                If you intend to terminate your pregnancy, remember that each issue is described in detail in a separate text, in which we will go step by step with you through all the stages of such an abortion.</p>
                <h3>Preparing for abortion with pills</h3>
                <ol><h4>Three steps before you start an abortion</h4>
                <li>First of all: make sure that you are definitely pregnant. All you need to do is perform a urine pregnancy test. You can buy it at a pharmacy or in a cosmetics store. Taking an abortion kit when you are not pregnant is not dangerous to your health, but there is no point in taking medication and unnecessarily burdening the body.</li>
                <li>Second: also check what week of pregnancy you are in. It is important to plan what dose of medication you should take and prepare for the process of induced miscarriage. Try to remember the date of your last menstrual period and use the pregnancy calculator available on the <a class="link-in-text" href="https://womenhelp.org/">womenhelp.org</a> website.</li>
                <li>Third: if you have an IUD and you cannot remove it, be prepared for the fact that the bleeding during the abortion will be heavier than usual. You can also read about the (very rare) other contraindications to medical abortion.</li></ol>
                <ul class="list-of-hygiene-products-container">List of hygiene products and handy trinkets for abortion:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Supply of sanitary pads</li>
                        <li>painkillers, but not antispasmodics (e.g. paracetamol, ibuprofen, pyralgin, ketonal, but not no-spa are recommended)</li>
                        <li>hot water bottle or hot water bottle</li>
                        <li>warm blanket in case of chills</li>
                        <li>something to drink (stay well hydrated throughout the process!)</li>
                        <li>possibly something light to eat (important: do not drink alcohol - you can smoke cigarettes)</li>
                        <li>favorite series 😉</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>Read dosage instructions
                Before taking the tablets, read the dosage instructions, as depending on whether you choose misoprostol alone or a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol, it depends on how you take the tablets.</p>
                <a class="link-in-text" href="https://adt.pl/aborcja/w-domu/dawkowanie/">Dosage of abortion pills</a>
                <h4>Ordering tablets</h4>
                <p>You will need a tablet pack consisting of mifepristone and misoprostol, or misoprostol alone (in a slightly larger amount than with the m&m kit)
                Pharmacological abortion is induced using the so-called abortion kit.
                The most popular solution is a set of abortion pills consisting of 1 tablet of mifepristone and 4 tablets of misoprostol. You can order such a set from <a class="link-in-text" href="https://womenhelp.org/">Women Help Women.</a></p>
                <p>Pharmacological abortion can also be performed using only misoprostol, available in Polish pharmacies in prescription drugs (under the name Arthrotec/Cytotec). This method has its pros and cons, and we recommend it mostly to people in the first weeks of pregnancy.</p>
                <h4>How to dose and take the tablets</h4>
                <p>We have prepared step-by-step guides for you to perform abortion with pills, tailored to the method you have chosen:</p>

                <p>The course of a pharmacological abortion varies slightly for each person Its essential elements include contractions, bleeding, and diarrhea, but the intensity and duration of these symptoms can differ Familiarize yourself with our step-by-step description of the process of pharmacological abortion to know what to expect</p>
                <a class="link-in-text" href="https://adt.pl/aborcja/w-domu/przebieg/">How does a medical abortion work?</a>
                <p>The process of pharmacological abortion in the second trimester (after 12 weeks) differs slightly from abortion in the first trimester, and although it is possible and safe, it is also more demanding for the body</p>
                <a class="link-in-text" href="https://adt.pl/aborcja/w-domu/drugi-trymestr/">Medical abortion in the second trimester</a>
                <p>It is also worth inventing some activity for yourself, preferably a physical one, to speed up the miscarriage process. However, if you feel very unwell, you can, for example, turn on your favorite movie and lie down. Also remember about your mental comfort and positive attitude - it is worth taking care to relax as much as possible.</p>
                <p>Abortion with pills will take from a few to several hours, so make sure you have time for it and are in a place with access to a bathroom where you feel comfortable.
                Detailed information on how long the various stages of abortion take, what their intensity is and what their characteristics are can be found in the instructions for a medical abortion and the course of a medical abortion after the 12th week.</p>
                <p>Abortion with pills at home can also be done after the 12th week of pregnancy. Sometimes people in the second trimester decide to do it, when for some reason they do not want to or cannot go for an abortion in a foreign clinic. Although the pills work effectively throughout pregnancy 13, the longer it is, the more difficult it is to go through the abortion on your own at home and the greater the risk that you will need the support of a doctor.</p>
                <p>The latest WHO guidelines recommend abortion with pills even until the very end of pregnancy13, with the graanica of 12 weeks marking the moment when the dosage of drugs changes. 2nd trimester abortions may require medical attention and completion in the hospital. Abortions in the 3rd trimester need to be completed in the hospital.</p>
                <a class="link-in-text" href="https://adt.pl/aborcja/w-domu/drugi-trymestr/"> How does a medical abortion in the second trimester work?</a>
                <p>For people who do not want to terminate their pregnancy after 12 weeks with medication, there is always <a class="link-in-text" href="https://adt.pl/">surgical abortion</a>.</p>
                <p>The uterus after an abortion can take up to several weeks to cleanse. This is accompanied by slight cramps and bleeding. Stopping bleeding for some time and its return in 2-3 weeks after the abortion are completely normal. We have described the process of uterine cleansing after a medical abortion 
                    <a class="link-in-text" href="https://adt.pl/aborcja/higiena/">in a separate text</a>
                     - we give some advice that will speed up the process and make it more comfortable. </p>
                <p>You will also find out there if and when you need to go for a check-up to a gynecologist, how long the bleeding lasts after an abortion with pills and how to take care of hygiene in the following days after.</p>

            <h2>Here's a quick guide to sorting out facts, evaluating resources and becoming more knowledgeable about the resources you use to find information.</h2>
            <ul class="fact-check-list">
                <li><b>Check Credentials</b> is the author specialized in the field that the article is concerned with? Does s/he currently work in that field? Check LinkedIn or do a quick Google search to see if the author can speak about the subject with authority and accuracy.</li>
                <li><b>Read the “About Us” section</b> does the resource have one? Reputable websites will have some type of About Us section and will provide a  way for you to contact them.</li>
                <li><b>Look for Bias</b> does the article seem to lean toward a particular point of view? Does it link to sites, files, or images that seem to skew to the left or the right? Biased articles may not be giving you the whole story.</li>
                <li><b>Check the Dates</b> like eggs and milk, information can have an expiration date. In most cases, use the most up-to-date information you can find.</li>
                <li><b>Check out the Source</b> when an article cites sources, it's good to check them out. Sometimes, official-sounding associations are really biased think tanks or represent only a fringe view of a group of people. If you can't find sources, read as much about the topic as you can to get a feel for what's already out there and decide for your self if the article is accurate or not.</li>
                <li><b>Examine URLs</b> we see quite a bit of domain manipulation these days. For example, what looks like an .edu domain, followed by .co or “lo” is likely a fake or deceptive site.  If you are you seeing a slightly variant version of a well-known URL, do some investigating.</li>
                <li><b>Suspect the sensational</b> when you see something posted that looks sensational, it is even more important to be skeptical. Exaggerated and provocative headlines with excessive use of capital letters or emotional language are serious red flags.</li>
                <li><b>Judge Hard</b> if what you're reading seems too good to be true, or too weird, or too reactionary, it probably is.</li>
                <li><b>Check your own search attitude and biases</b> is your search language biased in any way?  Are you paying more attention to the information that confirms your own beliefs and ignoring evidence that does not?</li>

            <h2>This guide to safe protesting was originally written in 2020 during the nationwide outcry over police brutality, which overwhelmingly targets Black people like George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. Whether you're marching for racial justice, reproductive rights, or climate conservation, our advice applies to most protests.</h2>
            <h3>What to Bring (and Not Bring) to a Protest</h3>
            <p>It's smart to have supplies on hand for a day of protesting. We recommend the following. You probably have everything you need around the house, and if not, these items will likely be accessible at your local stores.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A bag and/or backpack: You'll need something small and durable. I, Louryn, use a cheap daypack from Walgreens for most supplies, and I also strap on a belt bag, which I use to hold the essential items I'd need if I were to lose my backpack. Use whatever you have on hand that lets you keep your hands free. If you don't have anything, we have a list of our favorite fanny packs. And while your bag should be big enough to hold all the supplies you need, be sure to avoid anything too bulky.</li>
                <li>Water: There's a good chance that your protest will include a march, so you need to pay attention to proper hydration. Carry drinking water. Bring the biggest bottle that you can fit in your bag. Water can also be used to clean wounds and flush the eyes of anyone who's been hit with chemical gas or pepper spray.</li>
                <li>A face mask or bandana: There's still a pandemic going on, with over 1 million Americans dead from Covid-19. Take precautions and cover your face with a mask or bandana. Face coverings also have the benefit of shielding your identity from cameras and police surveillance. (We have a separate guide about digital privacy during protests.). Bring an extra mask if you have one.</li>
                <li>A hat and/or sunglasses: Aside from shielding you from the sun during a long day of marching, hats and sunglasses can obscure your face from surveillance and protect your privacy. If you wear a hat, and you're interested in further protecting your identity, keep the brim low.</li>
                <li>Snacks: You are likely in for a long day. Pack lightweight, nutritious, protein-rich snacks. Jerky, energy bars, and nuts are all good picks</li>
                <li>Protest signs: If you want to carry a sign, there are some things to consider. Ensure that your slogan is in big, bold letters that can be easily read from far away. Short and punchy sayings are arguably better than a block of script. Poster board is flexible, but stiffer foam board is more durable. You can affix paint-stir sticks or other flat, wooden sticks to the sign using strong tape to create a handle. You might want to make extras to hand out to fellow protesters. Don't litter—when you're done with your sign, dispose of it properly, or donate it to another protester.</li>
                <li>Suitable clothing: It's a good idea to wear all black, both because that's what the organizers of most solidarity protests suggest and because it helps you blend in with a crowd. It's also recommended that you cover any tattoos, if you can, and that you hide your hair if it's dyed a distinctive color.</li>
                <li>A change of clothes: If you're protesting on a particularly hot day, you may want to have extra clothes. These can also come in handy if you're exposed to substances that can hurt your skin or if you're splashed with paint, gross road water, or other people's sweat. I usually carry a pair of shorts, a tank top, and an extra pair of socks in my backpack</li>
                <li>Hand sanitizer: You might find yourself holding hands with a stranger, grabbing onto gunky street signs, or tripping and falling into a puddle. All these scenarios coupled with Covid-19 make hand sanitizer an essential thing to carry. Most stores now have at least some form of hand sanitizer in stock, but we also have a guide on making your own.</li>
                <li>Good walking shoes: This is nonnegotiable. Wear closed-toe shoes that are broken in and good for walking long distances.</li>
                <li>Your ID (maybe): If you're detained, not having your ID on you might keep you stuck for longer. However, in some states, you might not have to show the police your ID if they ask for one. Use your best judgment, and consider looking up the laws for your state for more specific guidance.</li>
                <li>Your phone (maybe): To protect your privacy and prevent surveillance, the best thing you can do is leave your phone at home. Consider using a secondary or burner phone instead. If you want to bring your phone, avoid using traditional phone calls and texts if at all possible. Signal is a secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging app that offers the option to delete messages after they're sent. You should also disable biometric unlocking, like FaceID or fingerprint features, and use a six-digit passcode instead. If you do need to carry your primary phone, keep it turned off until you absolutely need to use it. This will make it harder for law enforcement to track your movements.</li>
                <li>Cash: Just like your phone can leave digital breadcrumbs indicating your whereabouts, using your debit or credit card will make it easier for the authorities to track your movements. Instead, bring cash. Separate your bills; stash some in your bag, and keep some on your person, either in your shoe, your bra, your pants pockets, or somewhere else secure.</li>
                <li>A power bank: If you or members of your group will have a phone, you need to make sure that you have a way to charge devices. Other protesters may need to charge their gear as well. If you don't have one already, I really like this option from Anker. The company also makes another good power bank that's a bit smaller.</li>
                <li>Other things you may want: A cooling towel. Duct tape or gaffer's tape. A flashlight or a headlamp. Ibuprofen. Goggles. Blister-prevention patches. Extra hair ties. A pen and paper. A Sharpie. A laser pointer. Bandages or other first aid supplies. Ear plugs. Saline solution. Extra face masks. A copy of emergency phone numbers and a card declaring necessary medical information that someone may need to know if you're unable to tell them yourself (for example, if you have asthma or if you're hard of hearing). Medications that need to be taken on a schedule (in a labeled prescription bottle if possible) with the understanding that you may be away from home much longer than anticipated.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Before You Leave</h2>
            <h3>Educate Yourself</h3>
            <p>Do not go to a protest without knowing what it is you're fighting for. Don't show up and ask someone there to educate you. If you're an ally, do the work yourself and study as much as possible—not only about the actions you're protesting but the context around them. You might know that reproductive rights are threatened, but do you know about the historical fight for access to abortion in America? There are several books you can read right now to gain more knowledge about this topic.</p>
            <h3>Realize It's Not About You</h3>
            <p>Tony Williams, a member of MPD150, a Minneapolis-based coalition that has studied the history of police activity and seeks police-free alternatives to community safety, shared crucial advice for anyone who is not personally impacted, but wants to attend a protest. “The most important thing to realize—especially if you’re a white person going out for the first time to protest police brutality against Black people—is that you’re showing up in solidarity with other people,” said Williams. “It’s not your job to decide how things should go. It’s your job to show up and listen and be in support. Deprioritizing yourself is an incredibly important part of the experience.” Be prepared to amplify what others are saying. Be prepared to listen. If you aren't comfortable with potentially physically intervening, shielding vulnerable protesters from police violence, and listening more than you speak, your efforts to be an ally are likely better spent elsewhere.</p>
            <h3>Get in the Right Mindset</h3>
            <p>Mental preparation is important. Protesting can be physically grueling and emotional taxing. You may experience sheer joy. You might cry. You might get angry. You might get scared. Most likely, you'll experience all of the above. Take the time to prepare yourself before heading out. Make sure to drink some water, apply sunscreen, and eat a meal.</p>
            <h3>Know Your Rights</h3>
            <p>In the US, it’s entirely within your rights to peacefully demonstrate in public. The basic act of assembling and protesting action by the government is unquestionably protected, according to the First Amendment Coalition, a California-based nonprofit that’s committed to protecting freedom of speech. Also, as a general matter, “people have the right to film or otherwise document things that are happening in the public space,” says David Snyder, director of the FAC. “If police demand that you turn over your notes, I would say that you can assume they don’t have the right to seize that.” That said, if it comes down to a matter of force and you are physically outmatched, you may have to weigh the risks to your immediate personal safety, potentially have your notes or phone stripped from you, and pursue legal action later on. Also, Snyder notes, the First Amendment to the Constitution does not protect protesters who engage in unlawful activity, which includes destroying property or assaulting other people.</p>
            <h3>Form a Group</h3>
            <p>If you can avoid it, don't protest alone. It's important that you go with at least one other person so you can have each other's backs. There is strength in numbers. Know your "roles" within the group before you go so you can be prepared for anything. For example, maybe one of you is prepared to drive the group home if the situation gets dicey, maybe one of you has first-aid training, or maybe one of you is hyper-observant and prepared to monitor your surroundings to keep tabs on the vibe. Stay close to your group. Meet up beforehand, stick together the entire time, and leave the protest together. If you don't have a group, check social media sites—there are probably discussions where you can find people to meet up with locally.</p>
            <h3>Make a Plan</h3>
            <p>There will be a lot of people and a lot of emotions. You need to have a plan for what to do if the situation escalates. Pick a spot to meet if your group gets separated for a certain amount of time. (For example, if you get separated for more than 30 minutes, you meet back at a designated street corner.) It might be smart to have a few spots to meet at in case one is inaccessible. You should also have multiple routes planned for if you need to leave and streets are blocked off. Is there a curfew where you live? Have previous protests in your city escalated to violence? Will there be portable bathrooms stationed along the route, or should you map out places to relieve yourself after chugging water all day? Prep a plan.</p>
            <h3>Take Out Your Contact Lenses</h3>
            <p>If you're exposed to tear gas or pepper spray, contacts will make the experience much worse. Wear glasses if you have them. If you wear contacts, protect your eyes with sunglasses at the minimum, though ideally you'll be wearing goggles or keeping them handy. For the same reason, avoid wearing makeup or oil-based products like lotions, as the irritants in dispersion measures deployed by police can stick to them.</p>
            <h3>Write Down Emergency Numbers</h3>
            <p>Write down your emergency contacts' information. Write down the number of emergency legal counsel—several law firms offer pro bono representation for arrested protesters. Research the firms in your area. You may also want to write down the number of a local bond fund. You should have two copies of these phone numbers on your person—write them in the notepad stashed in your bag, on the hem of your shirt, or on a notecard that you keep in your pocket. As a redundancy, you can also write them somewhere on your body (like your forearms), preferably in permanent marker.</p>
